Now lets apply some routing to the weather app. 
Step 1: Build a nav bar for this app using react strap. Feel free to style it to look rad. 
Step 2: Make routes abnd links for a home page, current weather, and sunrise report (we'll make it today)
Step 3: Configure the app to render different components from each route. The 'current weather' will be the 
        table, icon widget, and search bar. We'll have to build the 'home page' and 'sunrise report'. 
Step 4: The home page will be a react-strap carousel that renders some weather images and info about the app. 
          (this is all the info about this I'm giving you - it doesn't need to be anything fancy). This will be the "/" path
          in our router.
Step 5: Make a 'sunrise report' component that renders the time of todays sunrise in the format Sunrise: hh:mm in large text, centered
        on the page. Using the giphy api and the weather description as keywords, grab a giphy image and set it to the
        background image for the sunrise time. Have this rendered when the user goes to appropriate url using react-router. 
Step 6: Put the icon widget in the right top corner of the nav bar. Challenge - only call the weather api once. You might have to 
        lift state.
